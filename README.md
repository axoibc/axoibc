### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a Remote Gaming Server for horse racing at Churchill Downs.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any Python or Go project.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: cunndev@gmail.com 

âš¡ Fun fact: I've worked on a lot of projects for use in the casino industry:
* Developed one of the first ticket in/ticket out systems for Bally Gaming and Systems (now Scientific Gaming). 
* Developed a cashless SmartCard system for IGT used in casinos in South Africa. 
* Developed a head to head service for video casino games so players can play against each other on casino cabinet games.
* Developed a licensing service for IGT which allows various games to be licensed on casino slot floors.
* Developed a service which can communicate, via serial slot lines, to all the slots on the floor using a RTOS.
